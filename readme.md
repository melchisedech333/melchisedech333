I am a developer who is currently becoming increasingly interested in mathematics and physics.

Currently I have dedicated myself to the study about the development of programming languages. And as an initial project, I have been dedicating myself to the development of the <a href="https://github.com/verbum-lang">Verbum Language</a>.
